 * Creation of "/controls/engines/engine[0]/oilcooler" in c46.nas
 * constantly overwrites <cooling factor> in engine file>
 * <cooling factor> should be around 0.6
 * set levers in animation to "/controls/engines/engine[0/1]/oilcooler" from 0 to 1
   * This Property is currently a "BOOL" - just 0 or 1 possible. 
 * Offset + (Impact*lever) = 0.6 + ( 0.1 * 1(lever full) ) = 0.7 max cooling/0.6 min cooling
